[x] subclasses
[ ] remove sell in decrement logic from update quality method (feels to side-effecty)
[ ] better encapsulation of item in item wrapper
[ ] add conjured item type

[ ] remove constants
[ ] add pluggability via Command-like pattern (think of class explosion if loads of additional item types are added)
